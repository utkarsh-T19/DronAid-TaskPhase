            <div class="sec6div2">
                Project DronAid is a one of a kind student project set in Manipal, India. We in an effort to make healthcare more 
                accessible and hassle-free. This will be achieved by creating an intelligent network of UAV systems that specializes
                in medical applications. By integrating Artificial Intelligence in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and app development we 
                hope to bring about practical clinical applications and emergency services at a community level.<br>
                In recent years, use of Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) have shown transformative results in the field of farming, defense 
                and energy production. Recognizing this development and in efforts to take it a step further, Project Dronaid was initiated
                and framed. We are a unique collaboration between the students and faculty of Manipal Institute of Technology(MIT) and 
                Kasturba Medical College(KMC).

                Applications of Our Tech:
            </div>
            <div class="sec6div2">
                There are a magnitude of applications to the technology that we are working on. A few of them have been listed below: <br>
                Emergency Services:<br>
                To carry small loads like oxygen cylinders, drug kit with essential drugs, blood and IV fluids in appropriate containers. 
                First aid kits with user manual or onboard instructions via webcam can also be carried. In case of major accidents, 
                tourniquets to stop bleeding or inflatable splints to support fractured limbs, cervical immobilizers can be transported for
                trauma patients. As these items will be transported via drones; they will reach the scene of the accident a lot faster than
                conventional ambulances. Blood samples can be procured by drones if paramedics are present at the accident scene which can 
                help in accelerating grouping and cross matching in patients with shock and blood loss. All these will drastically increase 
                the chances of patient survival.
                <br>Other Applications:

            <ul id="applicationList">
                <li>Delivery of medical products like drugs and blood to nearby satellite hospitals.</li>
                <li>Procurement of lab samples and other materials from satellite hospitals and thus reducing the time and use of vehicles between hospitals.</li>
                <li>Procurement of pathology specimens for biopsy from satellite hospitals.</li>
                <li>Monitoring and procurement of water or air samples, for research in the field of public health.</li>
